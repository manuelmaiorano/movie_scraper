## Motivation

I had a list of movies in a txt file, not sure how to choose one to watch each time. 
Scrapes movie descriptions and images off IMDB and generates index.html file in the htmldoc folder,
that can navigated to show each movie decription.

## Installation
Requires only requests_cache (an alternative to requests that caches), and beautifulsoup, create a virtual enviroment
and pip install those dependencies. Write movie titles in a file called queries.txt and run main.py.
